# Hangman

Doing this fun little game as a way for me to learn Java. I got inspired from this website:
https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part1/week-2/

The purpose of this fun activity is to learn how to use methods in Java. If anyone has any suggestions
on my code improvements, feel free to let me know.
